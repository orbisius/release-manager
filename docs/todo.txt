Todo
=======

scan readme for more checks
tags less than 5 chars
check readme -> short descr less than 150 chars

on release -> commit and push

update the UI rendering so it's quick scan and JS hook on document(element).on('click') and not when the page is fully
rendered.
or maybe expand only on click and not by default for a quick scan

test for duplicated header plugin tags?
